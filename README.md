# Human Detection Robot for Earthquake

Currently, the rescue team using a multiple device to detect the location of the victim inside the rubbles of building a proximately as possible and there were problems faced by users when using the current system. Therefore, a proposed robot has been planned to make further improvements to the current device as they still have room for improvements. The proposed robot is called Human Detection Robot and it is specifically designed to help the rescuer to detect human life when disaster happen especially in earthquake. The objective of the whole idea is to deliver a small and a reliable robot that can navigate through the rubbles of building. The current version of the detection devices was already being implemented to the rescuer team but the procedure of it conducting the detection process was done manually using human hand and it was quite risky considering the building condition is not stable and can be collapse in any time. By developing this project, the rescuer doesnâ€™t need to in the place all the time, the robot can be controlled as long there is an internet connection. This will ease the work for the rescuer to who are in charge to detect the victim.
